# Ragpi

Ragpi is an open-source AI assistant that answers questions using your documentation, GitHub issues, and READMEs. It combines LLMs with intelligent search to provide relevant, documentation-backed answers through a simple API. It supports multiple providers like OpenAI, Ollama, and Deepseek, and has built-in integrations with Discord and Slack. A web widget integration is also available to embed the assistant in your website.

## Example Workflow

Here's a simple workflow to get started with Ragpi once it's deployed:

### 1. Set up a Source with a Connector

- Use the [`/sources`](https://docs.ragpi.io/api#tag/Sources/operation/create_source_sources_post) endpoint to configure a source with your chosen connector.
- Each connector type has its own configuration parameters.

Example payload using the Sitemap connector:

```json
{
  "name": "example-docs",
  "description": "Documentation for example project. It contains information about configuration, usage, and deployment.",
  "connector": {
    "type": "sitemap",
    "sitemap_url": "https://docs.example.com/sitemap.xml"
  }
}
```

### 2. Monitor Source Synchronization

- After adding a source, documents will be synced automatically. You can monitor the sync process through the [`/tasks`](https://docs.ragpi.io/api#tag/Tasks/operation/get_task_tasks__task_id__get) endpoint.

### 3. Chat with the AI Assistant

- Use the [`/chat`](https://docs.ragpi.io/api#tag/Chat/operation/chat_chat_post) endpoint to query the AI assistant using the configured sources:

  ```json
  {
    "sources": ["example-docs"],
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "How do I deploy the example project?" }
    ]
  }
  ```

- You can also interact with the AI assistant through the [Discord](https://docs.ragpi.io/integrations/discord) or [Slack](https://docs.ragpi.io/integrations/slack) integration,
  or by embedding the [Web Widget](https://docs.ragpi.io/integrations/web-widget) in your website.
